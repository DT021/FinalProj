40 PT Rubric

20 - Student show that a significant amount of understanding has been gained about their desired subject area
10 - Significant amount of effort and time has been put into the project
10 - Code compiles and implements a specific goal in the desired subject area

Compliable task:
1. Found method to log time spent on the project and distributed this method
2. Create list of stocks that can be used to extract data from. These stocks should be based on the S&P500 indicator
3. Found K Nearest Neighbor algorithm to classsify data in a more simple way
4. Add to the linear regression code to calculate standard variation and average of data. This information will be used
in the preprocessed data
5. Download Python3, Numpy, SciPy, MatPlotLib, and pip3 

To do:
1. Calculate High and Low in percent of average stock price over that period and compare to S&P 500 to have a 
volitility check
2. Learn more about Fibonnacci retrace and how to implement it https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fibonacciretracement.asp
3. Think about how an all time average/all time low could tell something about a stock
	- Potentially the number of stocks above a retrace or the number of stocks below a certain retrace
4. Decide on value of moving averages, exponential moving average, and simple moving average as technical analysis techniques 


Potential Problems:
1. Does not account for when a company divides its stocks into smaller stocks
2. Does not account for huge growth and huge dip in same period
