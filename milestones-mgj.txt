Matthew Gray Jones - Milestones

40 PT Rubric

20 - Students show that a significant amount of understanding has been gained about their desired subject area.
10 - Significant amount of effort and time has been put into the project
10 - Code compiles and implements a specific goal in the desired subject area

Compliable task:
1. Found method to log time spent on the project and distributed this method
2. Found K Nearest Neighbor algorithm to classsify data in a more simple way
 

To do:
1. Ensure that the proper libraries are installed and that we understand how to use them.
2. Find API with daily stock data. It needs parameters such as volume, opening price, closing price, and adjusted closing price.
3. Define specific classification for a stock depending on parameters such as those listed in 1.
4. Understand K Nearest Neighbor algorithm and implement this on the stock data to predict classes.
5. Pre process data
6. Implement our own KNN on our data
7. Implement our own SVM on our data
